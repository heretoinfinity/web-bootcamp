            <h1>Welcome To Andreas08!</h1>
            <p>I get a lot of requests about new open source templates, and this
              one was created as a response to one of those requests. This
              template is based on the design of my own website, with only
              small changes (hopefully improvements!) from my own design. Among
              the changes, it is worth to note that this template does not use any
              images - and browser-based font resizing is fully supported. Other
              than that, there are no special features or extras, only valid and
              well-structured XHTML 1.1 and CSS2 code.</p>
            <p>Current template version: 1.0 (November 28, 2005).</p>
          </article>

          <aside class="welcome">
            <p> <strong>Note:</strong> This is a box. It can be used for special
              messages both in the sidebar and the content section. You could use
              it for special notes and announcements, but also as a frame for
              photos. This space can be used for a short website presentation!</p>
